I want:
when I press a shortcut
the selected / cursor-word is copied
a vscode webview opens https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview
with documentation (cppref, boost, etc) for that term

existing solutions:
https://devdocs.io/
    web app with a large libary of docs
    source https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs
    "set of normalized HTML partials and two JSON files (index + offline data)"
        https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs#scraper
    not usable in vscode (opens a separate browser window)
    actually this extension probably works
        https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=devdocs-adapter.devdocs-adapter
    does do fuzzy searching
dash ecosystem
    "Docsets are essentially just a folder containing the HTML documentation and a SQLite database that indexes the files."
        https://kapeli.com/docsets
    https://kapeli.com/dash
        macos app with a standard docs format, and large library of docs
    https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=deerawan.vscode-dash
        vscode extension just opens the native app (dash, zeal, ...), rather than in vscode webview
    https://zealdocs.org/usage.html
        linux equivalent of dash, same standard docs format and library
        doesn't do fuzzy searching

missing docs:
    boost
    ibis
    plotly

fzf is great

maybe the filename (e.g. /cpp/std/vector.html) is enough?
or maybe we need to strip the html to plain text and fzf on the contents
or maybe we could use doxygen tagfiles (for c/c++ at least)?

vscode features:
webview for html docs (basically all docs are in html format)
context menu for "open in docs"
"open in docs" finds the item under the cursor, translates it into a C++ namespace, then looks up the file using doxygen???
OR
terminal fzf search of "doctags" (the "class list" from doxygen, e.g. https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/annotated.html)

all docs have html tree
(almost) all c/c++ docs have a doxygen xml index and class list

all (dash) docs have an sqlite index
